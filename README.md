In this Project I will prepare a prototype of a machine learning model for Zyfra. Zyfra is a company that develops efficiency solutions for heavy industry.

In this task the model should predict the amount of gold recovered from gold ore. The model will help to optimize the production and eliminate unprofitable parameters.

My goal in this task is to predict recovery rates in the rougher and final concentrates. Recovery rates is a measure of the purification quality. If we can predict recovery rates, we can optimize the purification process, since the company Chemists can approximate the quality of the purification stages with different amounts of the various parameters that in use in the purification process, before actually execute the purification. This can be incredibly profitable for the company.
